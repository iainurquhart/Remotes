# Remotes

### Overview

Remotes lets you fetch/scrape/load remote data and store it locally for optional periods of time.

Data is simply fetched from any url you provide, then stored locally to your ExpressionEngine install's database and served via an ACTion ID.

Born from a simple need to store a slow remote JSON feed and have an admin refresh the feed on demand.
